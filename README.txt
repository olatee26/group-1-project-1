Our code is a demo for nan ATM system. it would prompt the user to select out of 4 options. the options include checking their balance, depositing money into their bank, withdrawing, and exiting the code if they are not interested in any of the options.
the code contains four switch statements, a do while loop, and an if else statement. we also made use of the locale.h manipulator in order to set a comma on our numeric outputs
the code was created on multiple zoom meeetings with each member contributing and helping with at least one part of the code.
Olatomiwa suggested the do while loop for the code
Shane came up with the idea to use switch statements
Mikayla helped with exiting the code
Javan helped with setting the locale.h 
Terrence helped with the if else statements
the challenging part of the code was finding the right loop to use and how to format our input so our output would be organized.
